            <h2>What is Animal Crossing New Horizons(ACNH)?</h2>
            <p>ACNH is a simulation game developed by Nintendo EPD, a division of the Japanese video game company <a href="index.html#nin">Nintendo</a>. It is available for purchase on the nintendo switch and the nintendo switch light systems. ACNH is the newest version of the Animal Crossing series. The first iteration of the Animal Crossing Game was released in 2001. The newest version of the game, ACNH, was released in 2020.</p>
            
            <h2>Game Play Overview</h2>
            <p>Within the game you are able to create a character who, at the very beginning, is ready to transition from their old life to a new one for a fresh start. This new home is an <strong>island</strong> in the middle of the ocean that is mostly bare with a minimal landscape like trees, large empty fields of grass, streams, rocks, and hills. The island is run by <a href="characters.html#chara">Tom Nook</a>, an entrepreneur who has recently bought up the land with the intention of building up the island to become a popular travel destination and home to many villagers and of course to make a lot of <em>bells</em> (money). He recruits you to help build up the island from scratch for the opportunity for you to make a lot of bells as well. As you find more and more resources, you continue to unlock and gain more abilities. You eventually gain full creative access to manipulate parts of the land like streams, hills, plants, and pathways and placement of things like houses, shops, bridges, inclines, furniture, and other various items. Over time your island upgrades substantially from camp-like, minimalist living to whatever you want it to be.</p>
            
            <h2>What can you do?</h2>
                
            <p>There are so many things you can do on your island. Here are just a few:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grow things like crops, trees, flowers, and other plants</li>
                    <li>Catch things like fish, bugs, and deep sea creatures</li>
                    <li>Collect things like fossils, art, DIYâ€™s, and natural resources</li>
                    <li>Sell items, build items, use items as materials to build other items or use them to decorate your island</li>
                    <li>Invite villagers to the island and grow friendships with many different personalities types</li>
            
                </ul>
            <p>You can do all of that and so much more!</p>
